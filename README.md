This project involves creating a simple text-based game or simulation in C++. It focuses on working with multiple header files, which define structures and function prototypes, and potentially using makefiles for compilation. The project introduces concepts such as pointers, structures, functions, and control structures like loops and conditional statements in C++.

The game involves characters engaging in battles, where a hero fights against multiple enemies. Each character has attributes like name, health, gold, and inventory items. The game mechanics include attacking opponents and managing inventory items. The code structure separates different aspects of the game into modules using header files, promoting modularity and code organization.
