## Game Simulation Project

### Overview
This project involves creating a simple text-based simulation in C++. It focuses on working with multiple header files, which define structures and function prototypes, and potentially using makefiles for compilation. The project introduces concepts such as pointers, structures, functions, and control structures like loops and conditional statements in C++.

### Game Mechanics
The game involves characters engaging in battles, where a hero fights against multiple enemies. Each character has attributes like name, health, gold, and inventory items. The game mechanics include attacking opponents and managing inventory items.

### Code Structure
The code structure separates different aspects of the game into modules using header files, promoting modularity and code organization.

### Object-Oriented Programming Concepts
The implementation also considers fundamental elements of object-oriented programming such as classes and objects, as well as concepts like encapsulation and associations between classes and objects, including cardinality and navigability. Additionally, concepts like inheritance, interfaces, polymorphism, and Creational Design Patterns are taken into account to develop an efficient and structured solution.
